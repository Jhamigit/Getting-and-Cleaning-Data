**Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

**Repo Files**  
        * *CodeBook.md*  code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformation or work that was performed to clean up the data  
        * *run_analysis.R*  script created to do the following 5 steps required for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project  
                1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
                2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
                3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
                4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
                5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
